One of the main elements I want in pixus is to be able to easily customise your image browsing experience via simple sliders. The goal here is to take away exact values so the user can just give an indication of what they are interested in. Below is an example of wanting new content nearby without caring about how popular it is

But this post is less about the UX and more about the underlying algorithm used to order items.
