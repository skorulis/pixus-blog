Pixus is a project that I've been working on for some time while a startup that I've been working for called [lenslife] looks to get funding to continue development. Today my goal is to start letting people know about what I'm doing because if no one knows about it then how can it ever be successful?

I've decided to build a blog using [jekyll] which takes markdown posts and generates HTML documents. This seems like a nice middle ground between having a WYSIWYG blog editor like medium and having to build full HTML pages. Since my background lies in iOS development I feel like an absolute novice setting these things up. Getting this up and running and being able to view the generated site has been really easy. The built site doesn't work when running it locally but it's fine if I run it in a server using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

So now that I've got the framework for building a blog I need to find somewhere to host it. Jekyll is hosted on [GitHub Pages] and I've seen it mentioned in a few other places so I decided to try it out first.

[GitHub Pages]: http://pages.github.com/
[jekyll]:      http://jekyllrb.com
[lenslife]:      http://http://lenslife.com.au
